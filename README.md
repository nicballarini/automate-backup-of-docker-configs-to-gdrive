# automate-backup-of-docker-configs-to-gdrive

I once had a drive failure scare that made me think I lost all my docker configs/compose files and resulting databases. This would have impacted my media, home automation and network utilities.

Luckily the drive did not fail, it was only overheated due to poor placement in a 3rd party case. To fix the issue I moved to a proper case, a decomished R720 :-D.

Anyhow, I had all my data again and wanted to automate the backup process off-site.

The source I'm basing my process on is here: https://medium.com/server-guides/backup-your-docker-files-to-google-drive-ae66e53af69b

I used this guide as a template, then customized the process to fit my needs. I also wanted to go a bit more granular with the backups and clean up the process a bit.
